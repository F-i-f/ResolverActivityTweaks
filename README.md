# Resolver Activity Tweaks

![Resolver Activity Tweaks banner: all three available styles](media/banner.png)

Yes, it now works on Oreo!™

## Requirements:

* Lollipop 5.0 or higher. Works on Lollipop, Marshmallow, Nougat and Oreo.

* An AOSP ROM.

* Xposed.

## Features:

This module changes the look and behavior of the dialog shown when picking an activity (app) to open a URL or document (intent).

On Lollipop, by default, you get a list of apps the very first time a given document type is opened.
Then, for the subsequent times, the last app is shown at the top, with an "Always" and a "Once" buttons, and the other apps are pushed down another header.

With this module you can pretty much remove some of the space wasted by all the headers and buttons by:

* Always using the "first time" menu, where the Always and Once buttons are shown at the bottom.

* Also hiding the Always and Once buttons too. In this case a single tap on the App name will launch the activity, and you won't be able to mark an app to "Always" launch any more.

These are the three possible configurations:

* Stock:

* Always use first time intent chooser (with the last selected app promoted to the top):

* Always use first time chooser and remove Always/Once:

Finally this is how the app looks:

## Changelog

### 2.1 — February 26, 2019

* EdXposed compatibility.

  The preferences application now looks up both EdXposed Installer as well as the regular Xposed Installer.

* Now on [GitHub](https://github.com/F-i-f/ResolverActivityTweaks).

### 2.0 — August 24, 2018

* Oreo Support.

  The way the Once and Always buttons are hidden has been changed in this release.

  The code is now simpler, and should work across all supported Android releases.

### 1.0.1 — October 11, 2017

* SDK Version back to 23 (MM) as `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` was causing an app crash on Nougat.

### 1.0 — October 11, 2017

Cosmetic changes only.
The module is working on Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat (this is not news, version 0.4 was fine as well)

* Updated target SDK to 25 (7.1 Nougat)

* Still show setting toggles when the module not active in Xposed, or when there is a version mismatch between the UI and the module (used to be hidden).

* Fix intent when opening the Xposed Installer, it could fail on some versions of the installer that do not implement the OPEN_SECTION intent.

* Log version in Xposed log file upon start-up.

### 0.4 — April 3, 2016

* Rebuilt against Xposed v81.

### 0.3 — March 2, 2016

* Marshmallow 6.0 compatibility.

* Note that because of Xposed limitations on Marshmallow, you will have to reboot to enact the changes. On Lollipop, the app is able to change the setting on the fly, and no reboot is needed.


### 0.2 — October 3, 2015

* Lollipop 5.0 compatibility: Target SDK v21 instead of v22. Thanks to XDA's Curious Boy.
* Fix FCs on CM12.1. Thanks to Alexey71 on XDA.
